# PHLang Syntax (minimal)

This document summarizes the tiny example syntax used for the scaffold.

- Comments: start with `#`
- Print: `print "text";`
- Assignment: `x = 1 + 2;`
- Basic control: `while (cond) { ... }`
- Functions: `func foo() { ... }`

This is intentionally minimal so you can design your own full grammar while implementing lexer/parser/AST.
